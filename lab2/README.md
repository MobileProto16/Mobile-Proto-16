# Lab 2

Your goal for this lab is to make an app that uses two APIs, where one of them has to be an Android API. 

You will have 2 weeks to complete this lab. **Lab 2 is due at 6:30pm on Thursday, October 27th.** This lab will be done in groups of either two or three. There should be two groups of three. You should work with new people on this lab.

[Here](./RUBRIC.md) is the rubric.

## Deliverables
We require these two things to be turned in:
* Your proposal + Wireframes + Design Explanation (Sun Oct 16)
* Your app (Thu Oct 27)

## MVP
The only requirement for this lab is that you use two APIs. One API has to be an Android API that interacts with your phone's hardware (see below for examples) while the other one can be either an Android or web API. All other requirements are scoped by your team in your proposal.

These are acceptable Android APIs that you can use. Let us know ahead of time if you want to work with a different API.

* [Camera](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/package-summary.html)
* [Sensors](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors_overview.html)
  * Motion
  * Environmental
  * Position
* [Infrared Emitter](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/ConsumerIrManager.html)
* [Near Field Communication (NFC)](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/index.html)
* [Bluetooth](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html)
* [Touch gestures](https://developer.android.com/training/gestures/index.html)

## Proposal
Before the end of today’s class (Thur Oct 13) each team will turn in a proposal. Include the following information:

* The names of everyone in your group.
* The two APIs.
* The feature(s) you plan on implementing as:
  * MVP
  * Stretch goals
* A quick write up on how you plan to divide up work and integrate features.
* Where you plan to be in a week (Thur Oct 20). We will be doing informal check-ins to monitor your progress.

After you've been approved by a teacher, put your proposal in your repository as `Proposal.md` and fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/bmjmlZdtBSrP9dkj1)

## Wireframes + Design Explanation

On Sun Oct 16 you will submit wireframes for your app. These can be drawn by hand or using software. Your wireframes should show all screens your app will have, and how your users will navigate/use the app. For each screen, write 2-3 sentences explaining:

- The purpose of the screen
- What the user can do in that screen/what all the buttons/elements on the screen will do.
- How the user can get to/away from the screen.

Put all of your wireframes + your explanations in a single file and upload it to your repo as `Design.`.

The wireframes are worth 35 points.
