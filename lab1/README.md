# Lab 1 - Restaurant App
Your goal for this lab is to make an app for a restaurant to manage incoming orders from customers.

- Your app will have two types of users: "cooks" and "customers".
- Cooks can add/edit/delete items in the restaurant's menu
- Cooks can see the pending orders that have been placed (and the customer that ordered each one) and can mark them as completed.
- Cooks can see an ingredient list for each menu item.
- Customers can view the menu and make orders by selecting one or more menu items to buy.
- Everything is stored in s3 or SQL so that menu items/orders/customers are saved when you exit the app
