## Lab Rubric(200 points total):
#### Proposal (10 points)
* 10 - You did the proposal and a teaching team member checked it off
* 0 - You did not do the proposal by the end of class

#### Wireframes (30 points)
* 30 - You created wireframes for all fragments/screens of your app. You created a rough design of what your app will look like. You clearly outlined the workflow of your app (fragment transitions, how users navigate the app, where the user enters/receives information)
* 15 - Information flow of your app is not clear from wireframes and/or you did not make an effort to design the aesthetics of your app. Parts of your design explanation were missing.
* 0 - You did not submit your wireframes.

### Final Deliverable (160 points)
#### Functionality: 70 points
##### Completion: 60 points
* 60 - You implemented all of the required features in the assignment. The assignment is complete
* 45 - All major features were implemented. You didn't get to one or two small features.
* 30 - Some of the required features were implemented.
* 15 - An attempt was made to implement some of the of the desired features.
* 0 - Very few or none of the desired features were implemented.

##### Bug free: 10 points
* 10 - The app is bug free
* 5 - Your app has one or two bugs, occasionally causing unexpected behavior
* 0 - Your app has multiple bugs, frequently causing unexpected behavior.


#### Design/Usability: 15 points
* 15 - Fragments are designed well, it is intuitive how to interact with the app.  User-facing strings are descriptive. The app is for the most part aesthetically appealing.
* 10 - A small part of the app was unintuitive to interact with or it was a bit ugly.
* 5 - Fragment transitions and/or information flow were unintuitive. It is difficult for a user to do what they want with your app.
* 0 - Your app was unintuitive to the point of being unusable.

#### Quality: 75 points

##### Git practices: 20 pts

* 20 - Separate branches were used for distinct features, master branch was kept “clean” and functional. Code was peer reviewed with pull requests before being merged.
* 10 - Not all code was reviewed before being merged. Each branch did not have a distinct purpose/feature.
* 0 - You frequently committed to master. You didn’t use/barely used branches.

##### Good coding practices: 20 pts

* 20 - Objects are intelligently designed and used where appropriate, inheritance used when appropriate, code is concise, naming conventions followed, proper access modifiers are used, public getters/setters are used instead of public variables, etc.
* 10 - Some of the above practices were broken, but you mostly followed good practices.
* 0 - Good coding practices were consistently broken.

##### Readability: 20 pts
* 20 - Functions and variables are named well. Code is well commented where appropriate. Confusing lines are commented. Lines are not too long.
* 10 - Code is occasionally confusing. Could use more comments. Some variables are poorly named.
* 0 - Code is difficult to read. Other developers would not be able to use your code.

##### Even work distribution: 15 pts
* 15 - You divided work fairly. Everyone had a significant contribution to your app.
* 10 - One person clearly did more/less than their fair share, but everyone was involved.
* 5 - Some people’s contributions were minimal
* 0 - One person did the whole app
