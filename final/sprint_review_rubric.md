# Design Review Rubric (100 points)
##### Adapted from POE Sprint Review Rubric. Thanks POE! <3


## Project Incrementation/Iteration (25 points)
The team stated their goals for the sprint, achieved the stated goals. The team presented a functional incrementation of their project.  The sprint iteration represents an improvement over previous sprint deliverables.


## Code Review (20 points)
The team presented a code segment, either for the purpose of a code review (where they ask for feedback on the piece of code), or to provide an overview of a concept that hasnâ€™t been covered in class before. For either option, the team emailed the class 24 hours before the sprint review with the following info:


- a link to their code snippet and line numbers (via github)
- relevant documentation the class should read (e.g., you want to show code about NFC. You link to [here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/nfc/package-summary.html)).
- either what concept you will be explaining to the class (just a one/two sentence description is fine) or question(s) you would like to ask the class/teaching team.
