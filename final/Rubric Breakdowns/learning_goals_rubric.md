# Learning Goals Rubric
Your learning goals will be graded by yourself. Each goal is out of 30 points. If you prefer to give yourself a letter grade instead (or some other reasonable grading scale), then feel free to, but note that we will convert it to a 30 point scale.

Here is a proposed grading scale that you can follow if it's helpful:
* 30 - I fulfilled this goal completely.
* 20 - I partially completed this goal or did not put in as much effort towards it that I could have.
* 10 - I put in minimal effort towards this goal.
* 0 - I made no effort towards this goal.
